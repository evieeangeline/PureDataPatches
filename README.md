# Sound and Music Computing

This is a compilation of projects I have made around sound and music computing - focusing around Gibber and Pure Data!
These were mainly created for a course I completed at the Australian National University - Sound and Music Computing/Laptop Ensemble.


[Gibber](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber) is a live coding environment for the web browser. Gibber runs via browser, you can click [here](https://gibber.cc/playground/index.html) to access the live editor. 

Pure Data is a visual programming language developed by Miller Puckette in the 1990s for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works. It can be downloaded [here](https://puredata.info/).
