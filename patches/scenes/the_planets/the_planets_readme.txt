Information: 

The patch uses actual data of the time it takes for each planet to cirle the sun,
as well as their relative starting location in their individual orbits, to create
a sound simulation of each planet - circling around your head by panning the sounds. 

Therefore, please use headphones or L and R speakers for the full effect.
